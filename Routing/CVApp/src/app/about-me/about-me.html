      <p class="intro-text">
        I'm Chelsea, an American who somehow ended up in Finland. The journey from Seattle to Vaasa wasn't exactly a straight line, 
        but here we are. I traded rain for snow, which in retrospect might not have been the smartest move, but at least the summers 
        are spectacular.

          <h3>Family</h3>
          <p>
            My husband Staffan is Finnish and I met him while in nursing school. This explains the whole "staying in Finland" thing. We also have Lucy, a 14-year-old 
            chihuahua who runs our household with an iron paw. She's small but mighty, and her opinions on everything are very well documented.

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me knitting or crocheting. There's something satisfying about creating tangible things 
            with your hands when you spend your day creating intangible things with code. I also bake, because apparently I needed 
            another hobby that requires precision and patience.

          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>
            I'm into modern metal music, especially bands like Imminence, Bad Omens, Electric Callboy, Lorna Shore, and Architects, which confuses people who assume that anyone who knits must exclusively listen to folk music 
            or classical. Turns out you can enjoy both intricate guitar riffs and intricate cable stitches. Who knew?

      <h2 class="section-title">The Career Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My path to software development has been... unconventional. I started with a degree in Fine Art and Communications 
        (useful for explaining technical concepts in plain English), worked at the US State Department (where I learned that 
        bureaucracy is universal), became a nurse (because apparently I like challenges), worked in manufacturing (quality control 
        is just debugging in the physical world), and finally landed in software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turns out all those seemingly random experiences actually prepared me pretty well for tech. Who would have guessed that 
        troubleshooting passport applications and assembling frequency converters would teach you how to debug code? Not me, 
        but here we are.

      <h2 class="section-title">Currently</h2>
      <p>
        I'm finishing up my Bachelor's in Information Technology at Vaasa University of Applied Sciences (GPA: 3.95/5, because 
        overachieving is apparently my thing). I'm particularly interested in web and mobile development, especially projects that 
        solve real problems. Like my WhereIs app, which helps you remember where you put things, because let's be honest, we all 
        need that.
